				Cory Sobon, Tifa Jade, and Mateo Julia-Wise collaborated for
				nearly three years at BoomTV, working with top brands and
				industry leaders to bring competitive and entertaining
				online experiences to life.
			</p>
			<!-- <p>
				Our collective efforts earned us the trust of major brands
				like Mountain Dew, Intel, Porsche, and Verizon, as well as
				renowned game publishers including Epic Games, Xbox, and
				Activision. We've designed and produced memorable events for
				titles like Fortnite, Valorant, Call of Duty, Splitgate,
				League of Legends, and Apex Legends. Our efforts and our
				craftsmanship consistently exceeded expectations from our
				partners, with our impression-grabbing video announcements,
				stunning graphics, with seamless event management.
			</p> -->
			<p>
				Now, we're excited to bring that expertise to Tiny Pond and
				offer it to you directly.
			</p>
			<!-- <div class="divider"></div> -->
			<p>
				At Tiny Pond, we operate as a cooperative, focused on
				collaboration and mutual support. Without a traditional
				hierarchy of managers, CEOs, or shareholders to answer to,
				our goal is simple: <b>produce great results.</b> That means
				every investment in Tiny Pond directly supports our cause:
				making more awesome stuff, for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s explore how Tiny Pond can bring your ideas to life. We
				can't wait to
				<a href="#contact">work with you.</a>

		<h2>Our Values</h2>
		<p>
			We're big on values at Tiny Pond. When you work with us, you know
			what we stand for: the pillars that guide both our work, and our
			conduct as a team.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="about__values-layout">
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Embrace Collaboration.</span>
				Like frogs in a pond, we know the best results come when we
				all leap together. Fluidly working together keeps our
				ecosystem healthy.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p class="bold-text">
				<span>Own Your Work.</span>
				We take pride in our leaps — and we’re always ready to
				explain our thinking process. Accountability means standing
				by our work and being transparent about our decisions.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Happy People, Happy Frogs.</span>
				Here, humans make all the art, <b>not AI.</b> Likewise,
				we're invested in our clients as people, not just business
				partners. We're all about human connections and healthy
				relationships.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Trust in the Pond.</span>
				Our goal is to keep things clear and open — no murky waters
				here. <b>Trust goes both ways!</b> We remain clear and open
				through our whole collaboration, and we expect you to grant
				us the trust we need to make the creative decisions you
				count on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Remote-First, Remote-Always.</span>
				With team members across the US, we use technology to keep
				us all on the same lily pad, making sure distance doesn’t
				slow us down.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Continuous Evolution.</span>
				Just like a tadpole transforms into a frog, we’re all about
				growth and change. <b>We embrace every opportunity</b> to
				evolve, learn, and improve, ensuring we stay fresh,
				innovative, and ready to take on any challenge.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Cultivate Long-Term Partnerships.</span>
				We don't want you to just dip your toes in the pond. Our aim
				is to
				<b>build long-lasting relationships</b> that grow over time,
				just like a pond’s ecosystem. Together, we’ll develop a deep
				understanding based on trust and open, friendly
				collaboration.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Do Good, Be Good.</span>
				We prioritize relationships that share our commitment to
				<b>making the world a better place.</b> We're pro
				sustainable practices and positive social impact
				initiatives. A thriving pond benefits every frog, fish, and
				friend within it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Excellence in Everything We Do.</span>
				We’re dedicated to hopping above and beyond. Our goal is to
				deliver work that <b>exceeds expectations.</b> When you our
				team loose, expect us to naturally become your go-to
				creative solution.
