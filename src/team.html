				The three of us—Cory Sobon, Tifa Jade, and Mateo
				Julia-Wise—collaborated for nearly three years at BoomTV,
				where we brought exceptional gaming experiences to life
				through dynamic branding, engaging videos, and a strong
				commitment to professionalism and care in our work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, we're excited to bring that expertise to Tiny Pond and
				offer it to you directly.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Tiny Pond, we operate as a cooperative, focused on
				collaboration and mutual support. Without a traditional
				hierarchy of managers or a CEO to answer to, our goal is
				simple: <b>produce great results.</b> That means every
				investment in Tiny Pond directly supports our cause: making
				more awesome stuff, for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s explore how Tiny Pond can bring your ideas to life. We
				can't wait to <b><a href="#contact">work with you.</a></b>
