			A one of a kind Valorant tournament experience. Featured in Riot
			Games' official Valorant Champions Tour, Valorant Select featured
			character bans and selections as part of its tournament format.
			Tiny Pond artists designed a custom broadcast experience for this
			event, allowing viewers to watch map picks/bans, and character
			selections play out in real time through custom API integration.
