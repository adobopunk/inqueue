<p>
	Today marks the official launch of In Queue, an independent esports
	production company built by veterans to put competitive integrity and
	community back at the heart of gaming. We're tearing up the traditional
	playbook to create tournaments where players set the rules, skill
	determines the spotlight, and every match gets the production quality it
	deserves.
</p>
<h3>The Team Behind the Vision</h3>
<p>
	Leading the charge is Operations Director Cory "Mazida" Sobon, whose 4+
	years at BoomTV saw him administer over 300 tournaments and distribute $3
	million in prizes through partnerships with Activision, Respawn, and Xbox.
	He's joined by creative visionaries Mateo Julia-Wise and Tifa Jade (TJ),
	whose combined expertise has shaped 400+ tournaments reaching 200K+
	concurrent viewers and generating 100M+ social impressions for titles like
	Fortnite, Halo, and Valorant.
</p>
<p>
	After years of working within traditional esports structures, we recognized
	the need for a platform that truly serves competitors first. In Queue is
	our answer - where every decision, from rule sets to broadcast production,
	starts with community input.
</p>
<p>
	"We've seen esports at its best and worst," says Mazida. "In Queue is our
	chance to prove tournaments can thrive when you cut out the corporate
	middlemen and listen to the people who actually compete."

<p>
	As illustrated in our brand launch video, In Queue has codified its
	philosophy into non-negotiable operating principles:
</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<h3>Community</h3>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<h3>Excellence</h3>

<p>
	These are the foundations that shape how we run In Queue, as well as our
	expectations from the community when contributing, competing, and engaging
	within our spaces. You can read more about our commitment to these values
	<a href="/about"> here.</a>
</p>

<h3>First on the Docket</h3>
<p>
	In Queue has already begun laying the groundwork for its first wave of
	events, with announcements coming soon. Players and fans can expect to hear
	about our first Apex Legends event in the coming week.
</p>
<p>
	Apex Legends Ladies Night events remain a high priority for us as they did
	under Proving Grounds, but finding the correct brand to back the program is
	important to us. We're working hard to find a brand with values that align
	with our goals, and hope to share news with you soon.
</p>
<p>
	Previous Proving Grounds fans and players can look forward to a revamped
	Discord launch this Friday, with an exciting set of new features. Proving
	Grounds veterans, your new home is around the corner. If you haven't
	already joined the Discord,
