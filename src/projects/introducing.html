<p>
	Today marks the official launch of In Queue, an independent esports
	production company built by veterans to put competitive integrity and
	community back at the heart of gaming.
</p>
<p>
	We're tearing up the traditional playbook to create tournaments where
	players set the rules, skill determines the spotlight, and every match gets
	the production quality it deserves.
</p>
<h2>The Team Behind the Vision</h2>
<p>
	Leading the charge is Operations Director Cory "Mazida" Sobon, whose 4+
	years at BoomTV saw him administer over 300 tournaments and distribute $3
	million in prizes through partnerships with Activision, Respawn, and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
	He's joined by creative visionaries Mateo Julia-Wise and Tifa Jade (TJ),
	whose combined expertise has shaped 400+ tournaments reaching 200K+
	concurrent viewers and generating 100M+ social impressions for titles like
	Fortnite, Halo, and Valorant.
</p>

<p>
	In Queue is our chance to prove tournaments can thrive when you cut out the
	middlemen and listen to the people who actually compete.

<h2>Our Foundational Pillars</h2>
<p>
	In Queue has codified its philosophy into non-negotiable operating
	principles:
</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>
	Staying true to the soul of competition. Radical transparency with the
	community. Success is measured in the unforgettable moments we help create,
	not profit margins.
</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>
	Tournaments are shaped by the community. The input of players and fans is
	our most valuable asset. We're passionate about shaping a space all about
	mutual respect and a love of the game.
</p>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>
	An esports ecosystem where background, connections, and geography don't
	dictate opportunity. Greatness can come from anywhere. We'll uplift stories
	of the most skilled players, regardless of follower count. Bring your best
	and we'll handle the rest.
</p>
<h3>Excellence</h3>
<p>
	We don’t do ‘good enough.’ Neither should you. We promise to treat every
	detail like it’s the grand finals. Premium experiences, no compromises.
	Push greatness. If you talk trash—back it up. Respect the craft, respect
	each other.
</p>

<p>
	These are the foundations that shape how we run In Queue, as well as our
	expectations from the community when contributing, competing, and engaging
	within our spaces. You can read more about our commitment to these values

</p>

<h2>First on the Docket</h2>
<p>
	In Queue has already begun laying the groundwork for its first wave of
	events, with announcements coming soon. Players and fans can expect to hear
	about our first Apex Legends event in the coming week.
</p>
<p>
	Apex Legends Ladies Night events remain a high priority for us as they did
	under Proving Grounds, but finding the correct brand to back the program is
	important to us. We're working hard to find a brand with values that align
	with our goals, and hope to share news with you soon.
</p>
<p>
	Previous Proving Grounds fans and players can look forward to a revamped
	Discord launch this Friday, with an exciting set of new features. Proving
	Grounds veterans, your new home is around the corner. If you haven't
	already joined the Discord,
