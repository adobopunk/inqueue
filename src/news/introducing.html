<p>
	Today marks the official launch of In Queue, an independent production
	company built by esports veterans to put competitive integrity and
	community back at the heart of gaming.
</p>
<p>
	At In Queue, we're tearing up the traditional playbook to create
	tournaments where players decide on the rules, skill determines the
	spotlight, and every match gets the production quality it deserves.

<h2>The Team Behind the Vision</h2>
<p>
	Operations Director Cory "Mazida" Sobon previously spent over four years at
	BoomTV, where he administered over 300 tournaments and distributed just
	under $3 million in prizes through partnerships with Activision, Respawn,
	and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
	He's joined by creative visionaries Mateo Julia-Wise and Tifa Jade (TJ),
	whose combined expertise has shaped 400+ tournaments reaching 200K+
	concurrent viewers and generating 100M+ social impressions for titles like
	Fortnite, Halo, and Valorant.
</p>

<p>
	Together, In Queue is our chance to prove tournaments can thrive when you
	cut out the middlemen and listen to the people who actually compete.
</p>

<h2>Our Foundational Pillars</h2>
<p>
	In Queue has codified its philosophy into non-negotiable operating
	principles:
</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>
	Staying true to the soul of competition. Radical transparency with the
	community. Success is measured in the unforgettable moments we help create,
	not profit margins.
</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>
	Tournaments are shaped by the community. The input of players and fans is
	our most valuable asset. We're passionate about shaping a space all about
	mutual respect and a love of the game.
</p>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>
	An esports ecosystem where background, connections, and geography don't
	dictate opportunity. Greatness can come from anywhere. We'll uplift stories
	of the most skilled players, regardless of follower count. Bring your best
	and we'll handle the rest.
</p>
<h3>Excellence</h3>
<p>
	We don’t do ‘good enough.’ Neither should you. We promise to treat every
	detail like it’s the grand finals. Premium experiences, no compromises.
	Push greatness. If you talk trash—back it up. Respect the craft, respect
	each other.
</p>

<p>
	These are the foundations that shape how we run In Queue, as well as our
	expectations from the community when contributing, competing, and engaging
	within our spaces. You can read more about our commitment to these values

</p>

<h2>First on the Docket</h2>
<p>
	In Queue has already begun laying the groundwork for its first wave of
	events, with announcements coming soon. Expect to hear about our first Apex
	Legends event in the coming week.
</p>
<p>
	Apex Legends Ladies Night events remain a high priority for us as they did
	under Proving Grounds, but finding the correct brand to back the program is
	important to us. We're working hard to find a brand with values that align
	with our goals, and hope to share an update with you soon.
</p>
<p>
	Proving Grounds veterans, your new home is around the corner. Community
	members can look forward to a revamped Discord launch this Friday, with an
	exciting set of new features. If you haven't already joined the Discord,
