<h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
<p>
	We reject the corporatization of competition. We refuse to treat players as
	content and fans as metrics. This is our declaration of independence.
</p>
<p><b>1. THE COMMUNITY IS THE COMMISSIONER</b></p>
<p>
	No more decisions made in boardrooms by people who've never queued at 3AM.
	Tournament formats will be voted on. Rule changes will be debated openly.
	The crowd's roar matters most.
</p>
<p><b>2. SKILL IS THE ONLY CURRENCY</b></p>
<p>
	No pedigree requirements. No "industry insider" fast passes. If you can
	compete, you will be seen. We're building pipelines, not walls.
</p>
<p><b>3. PRODUCTION IS PROMISE</b></p>
<p>
	If it's not good enough to study, it's not good enough to stream. Every
	broadcast must:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make new fans feel welcome</li>
	<li>Give veterans new insight</li>
	<li>Honor the game's soul</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. NO MORE TEMPORARY ESPORTS</b></p>
<p>
	We won't abandon games when the hype fades. We won't chase trends at the
	cost of legacy. The titles you love deserve more than a retirement home -
	they deserve evolving competition.
</p>
<p><b>5. TRANSPARENCY OR BUST</b></p>
<p>
	There are no silent partners at In Queue. We're independent, we own our
	work, and we value the community's support more than anything. When we
	screw up, you'll hear it from us first - with a plan to fix it.
</p>
