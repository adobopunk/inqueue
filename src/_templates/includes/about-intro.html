				In Queue was founded by esports veterans who grew tired of
				seeing competition take a backseat to commercial interests.
				We’ve worked across every level of the industry – from
				running local LANs to producing global championships – and
				we’re channeling that experience into building something
				different.
			</p>

			<p>
				We’re not trying to reinvent esports – we’re fighting to
				preserve what made it great while pushing it forward. This
				isn’t about “disrupting” esports. It’s about returning it to
				the people who made it matter:

			<h3>Who We Are</h3>
			<img src="/img/IMG_1831.webp" alt="" />

			<p>
				We’re the disillusioned architects of esports’ biggest
				stages – now building something that we're deeply passionate
				about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directing all things operational is Cory Sobon, a veteran
				tournament director who's administered over 300 events and
				paid out more than $3 million in prizes. Having worked with
				giants like Activision, Respawn, and Xbox while founding the
				community-focused Proving Grounds circuit, Cory, known in
				the gaming sphere as Mazida, brings both elite experience
				and a refusal to compromise competitive integrity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our creative vision comes from
				<a href="http://tinypond.studio" target="_blank"
					>Tiny Pond</a
				>
				- the powerhouse creative studio run by partners Mateo
				Julia-Wise and Tifa Jade (TJ). Mateo brings six years of
				esports design mastery, from grassroots tournaments to
				events for Tier 2 Overwatch, Fortnite, and Rocket League.
			</p>
			<p>
				TJ merges UFC production pedigree with deep esports roots
				that date back to the H1Z1 Pro League. She's directed
				cinematic event visuals for some of the biggest tournaments
				and influencers in the gaming sphere. Together, their work
				has ignited hype for over 400 tournaments, commanding main
				stages with 200K+ live viewers and amassing 100M+
				impressions.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're proud to be employee-owned and fiercely independent.
				Every dollar we earn goes back into the community – funding
				better tournaments, fairer opportunities, and the authentic
				esports experience fans deserve. No outside investors
				dictating our direction. No profit-above-all mentality. Just
				the pure competitive spirit that started it all.
			</p>

			<h3>Why We're Here</h3>
			<p>
				Our mission is simple: to create premiere competitive
				experiences that stay true to esports’ roots. We believe
				world-class tournaments don’t require compromising
				authenticity. Through open formats, community-driven
				decisions, and production that prioritizes the essence of
				competition, we’re here to prove esports can evolve without
				losing its soul.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is esports on its own terms. Welcome to the Queue.
