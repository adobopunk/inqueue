			<h1>Built By The Community. Fueled By Passion.</h1>

			<p>
				At In Queue, we believe esports isn’t a product to sell—it’s
				a culture to nurture. Our tournaments aren’t dictated by
				algorithms or boardroom quotas. They’re shaped by you, the
				players, fans, and dreamers who breathe life into this
				world.
			</p>
			<h3>Why We're Here</h3>
			<p>
				Esports thrives when its heartbeat is the community, not the balance sheet. We’re here to prove that competitive gaming can stay true to its roots: raw passion, unscripted moments, and a stage where skill speaks louder than sponsors.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’re not anti-business. We’re anti-bullshit.
			</p>
			<h3>How We Operate</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>    Community-Built Formats: Tournaments are designed through Discord polls, Reddit AMAs, and player panels—not corporate surveys.

					
						<li>
							Open Door Talent: Casters, analysts, and obs leads are scouted from grassroots streams, not agency rosters.

						</li>
						<li>						No Silent Partners: Our funding comes from partnerships with brands that get it, not investors chasing ROI.</li>
					</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<h3>Join The Movement</h3>
			<p>This isn’t about “disrupting” esports. It’s about returning it to the people who made it matter: <a href="#contact">you.</a> </p>
