				Cory Sobon, Tifa Jade, and Mateo Julia-Wise collaborated for
				nearly three years at BoomTV, working with top brands and
				industry leaders to bring competitive and entertaining
				online experiences to life.
			</p>
			<!-- <p>
				Our collective efforts earned us the trust of major brands
				like Mountain Dew, Intel, Porsche, and Verizon, as well as
				renowned game publishers including Epic Games, Xbox, and
				Activision. We've designed and produced memorable events for
				titles like Fortnite, Valorant, Call of Duty, Splitgate,
				League of Legends, and Apex Legends. Our efforts and our
				craftsmanship consistently exceeded expectations from our
				partners, with our impression-grabbing video announcements,
				stunning graphics, with seamless event management.
			</p> -->
			<p>
				Now, we're excited to bring that expertise to Tiny Pond and
				offer it to you directly.

				At Tiny Pond, we operate as a cooperative, focused on
				collaboration and mutual support. Without a traditional
				hierarchy of managers, CEOs, or shareholders to answer to,
				our goal is simple: <b>produce great results.</b> That means
				every dollar you invest in Tiny Pond directly supports our
				cause: making more awesome stuff, for you!

		<h1>Our Values</h1>
		<p>
			We're big on values at Tiny Pond. If you want to work with us,

		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Happy People, Happy Frogs.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Remote-First, Remote-Always.</span>
				With team members across the US, we use technology to keep

				slow us down.

		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Continuous Evolution.</span>

				innovative, and ready to take on any challenge.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Cultivate Long-Term Partnerships.</span>
				We don't want you to just dip your toes in the pond. Our aim
				is to
				<b>build long-lasting relationships</b> that grow over time,
				just like a pond’s ecosystem. Together, we’ll develop a deep
				understanding based on trust and open, friendly
				collaboration.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Do Good, Be Good.</span>
				We aim to prioritize relationships that share our commitment
				to <b>making the world a better place.</b> We're pro
				sustainable practices and positive social impact
				initiatives. A thriving pond benefits every frog, fish, and
				friend within it.

		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Excellence in Everything We Do.</span>
				We’re dedicated to hopping above and beyond. Our goal is to
				deliver work that <b>exceeds expectations.</b> When you our
				team loose, expect us to naturally become your go-to
				creative solution.
