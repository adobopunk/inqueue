			<h1>Connect With Us</h1>
			<p>
				At In Queue, we believe the best partnerships are built on
				shared values—not just logos on a stream. Here, your brand
				becomes part of the story, not a disruption to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’re growing a community where players, creators, brands,
				and innovators can thrive together. Whether you’re a caster
				looking for a stage, a brand that believes in fair play, an
				educator shaping the next generation of competitors, or a
				storyteller passionate about esports, we want to hear from
				you. Our doors are open to those who share our mission: to
				make competition more authentic, accessible, and exciting
				for everyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’re ready to contribute your voice, your creativity,
				or your support to the future of esports, let’s start the
				conversation. We’re selective because we care deeply about
				our ecosystem—but if your values align with ours, we’d love
				to explore how we can work together.
